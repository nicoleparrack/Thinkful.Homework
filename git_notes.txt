how to push to github

only run this once 

1) git init 

2) go into github and create a new repo 

3) git add . 

4) git commit -m "You message, generally whatever you did"

once you do this copy and paste the commands from the section
"or push an existing repository from the command line"


after the first push you just need to do 

acpp "My commit message"

this is an alias normally you would need to do three steps

1) git add . 
2) git commit -m "My message"
3) git push
